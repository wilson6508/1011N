The reason you can change the name of the test.jar file in Linux 
while the program is running but not in Windows 
is likely due to differences in how each operating system handles open files.

In Linux, a file can be opened and executed even if it is renamed or deleted, 
as long as the file descriptor for that file is still valid. 
This is because in Linux, a file is identified by its inode number, 
not its name. So when you execute java -jar test.jar in Linux, 
the operating system opens the file and creates a file descriptor for it. 
Even if you rename or delete the file, the file descriptor remains valid and the program can continue to access the file.

In Windows, on the other hand, a file cannot be renamed or deleted while it is open. 
This is because Windows uses file handles to identify open files, which are based on the file name rather than an inode number. 
So if you try to rename or delete test.jar while it is running in Windows, 
the operating system will prevent it because the file handle is still open.

It's worth noting that even though you can change the name of the test.jar file in Linux while it's running, 
it's generally not a good idea to do so. 
This can lead to confusion and unexpected behavior, 
especially if the program tries to access the file by its original name. 

It's better to stop the program first, rename the file, 
and then restart the program with the new name.
